Next Meeting:
    indholdfortegnelse -> Done

    + analyse eksempler: How indepth to document?
    SSR eksempel
    Code finish -> Merge sections

Done:
    Integration
    Var -> Var and Arr

Merge QCheck
Improve outputs?

MetaL rework:
    Add ARR
    TFS set vs larger sets: change syntax! -> Prevent VAR U ARR !, add this to grammar too?
    Easy extensions: P( -> ), P( P() )
    Cartesian Domain: Possible extension to 4/5/6... domains
    Reuse alreade made parts? as seen in example RD3, or require universaly unique labels

Examples analysis:
    New RD
    Signs and SSR analysis

Examples code:
    Code using arrays (array sum?)

Grapher rework: Use function defined in report

Unify QuickChecking into Framework
Work on Quickchecking
Report: Define reader

Worklist: Efficient/spec?
 

Analysis module:
    write using lattice operations as parameters union...
    
Manual work:
    NOTE: Precedence is highest for domain product! -> no Q -> (P(Q) * P(Q))?
    subset_pN

Improvements: Find underlying equal structures, and reuse types
