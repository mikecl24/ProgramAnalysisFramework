Questions:
    Requirement that initial and final nodes are different needed? (in PG definition)

Generating Bottom:
    metaL join languages
    SimpleSet
    Generating top?????? (maybe use duality? Can you always do so?)

Done:
    Extensions  P( -> ), P( P() )
    Signs Example
    Graph extension parsing

Next Meeting:
    Conclusion
    Graph work
    SSR eksempel
    Code finish -> Merge QCheck
    Report
    Lit revciew: tools conf... 
        esop acm...

consolidateAST graphs
gen calls and domain graphs

Improve Signs example boolean TF?

Test backward analysis! might be taking wrong node as last

MetaL rework: graphs/sets

Examples code:
    Code using arrays (array sum?)

Unify QuickChecking into Framework
Work on Quickchecking
Report: Define reader

Worklist: Efficient/spec?

Analysis module:
    write using lattice operations as parameters union...
    
Manual work:
