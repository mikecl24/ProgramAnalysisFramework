New module:
    Variables extraction in Parser
    graph reversal module

Domain Generation unimplemented:
    Deal with cartesian in domains "properly" -> tuple

Lattice operation notes:
    subset_p (cartesian product of domains) only for 2: otherwise need to save them as (dom, opt(dom)) and last element is None!
    cartesian product of domains also has to be a tuple now (no way of iterating through records properly, unless using some code generation)   
    Implement union, intersection, superset

Analysis module:
    write using lattice operations
    test back/forward, must/may

Parser:
    Use AST instead of text
    
Examples:
    New RD
    Signs and SSR analysis
    
Manual work:
    Cartesian rework (max 2)
    NOTE: Precedence is highest for domain product! -> no Q -> (P(Q) * P(Q))?
