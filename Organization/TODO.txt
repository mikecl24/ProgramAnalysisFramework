References:
    subsetOP: subset sequence!

Domain Generation:
    sigma = first lookup!
    Traces for functions

MetaL rework:
    TFS set vs larger sets: change syntax!
    Easy extensions: P( -> ), P( P() )
    Cartesian Domain: ext to support max 3 otherwise error

Examples:
    New RD
    Signs and SSR analysis

Grapher rework: Use function defined in report

Unify QuickChecking and DomainGen Module into Framework
Work on Quickchecking
Report: Define reader

Worklist: Efficient/spec?

Lattice operation notes:
    subset_p (cartesian product of domains) only for 2: otherwise need to save them as (dom, opt(dom)) and last element is None!
    better: susbset_p takes a parameter number which is the size of the cartesian, and acordingly calls for 2,3,4... (finite amount of choices)
    cartesian product of domains also has to be a tuple now (no way of iterating through records properly, unless using some code generation)

Analysis module:
    write using lattice operations as parameters union...
    test back/forward, must/may
    
Manual work:
    NOTE: Precedence is highest for domain product! -> no Q -> (P(Q) * P(Q))?
