Note: Split Variables and Arrays!, add to MetaL

MetaL rework:
    TFS set vs larger sets: change syntax!
    Easy extensions: P( -> ), P( P() )
    Cartesian Domain: Possible extension to 4/5/6... domains

Examples:
    New RD
    Signs and SSR analysis

Analysis module:
    write using lattice operations as parameters union...
    test back/forward, must/may
    
Manual work:
    NOTE: Precedence is highest for domain product! -> no Q -> (P(Q) * P(Q))?

Improvements: Find underlying equal structures, and reuse types
