New RD
Signs and SSR analysis

New module:
 Node range generation in grapher
 Variables extraction in Parser
 
Replace Dictionary with Map maybe
Use AST's

Add functionality for iota in the last node instead of in the start?
enforce type output and input everywhere
Allow must analyses (Switch condition and result in Analysis!)
Allow backward analyses

Domain tests: P(Q) - singleton powersets?
              P(Q)*P(Q)
              P([Q*Q U {QM}])

Parser: var_if_test
Flaten cartesian dom!
TF -> names not prepending R1_, fix
Manual work
Implementation notes: name gen
Edges contain ints, but should contain nodes!
1. Use maps
2. expand gen

Done: 
    Flatten lists and cartesian sets
    RD Dom generation

WIP
    No longer Fact: All analyses are powersets 
    Maps + direction + nature? Analysis module
        functions as parameters: union/intersec + subseteq/superseteq
    how to generate subseteq/superseteq function (dom * dom) and (map -> map ...)
                                                        map (set*set)->P()
        does this happen as domain is generated, or post, using the instance
        Fact: All analyses must contain at least one powerset (graph extensions will break this!)
    how to generate union/intersec
