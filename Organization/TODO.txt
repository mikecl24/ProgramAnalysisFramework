Done:   Report section written
        Cartesian domains

Goals: Write report
Work on Quickchecking
Report: Define reader

Possibilities: Require |Var| = |Node| -> redefine map generation accordingly

New module:
    graph reversal module


MetaL rework:
    TFS set vs larger sets: change syntax!
    
Get trace function for subset parameter (subset_m subset_m ...)
Consolidate Folder structure
    
Lattice operation notes:
    subset_p (cartesian product of domains) only for 2: otherwise need to save them as (dom, opt(dom)) and last element is None!
    better: susbset_p takes a parameter number which is the size of the cartesian, and acordingly calls for 2,3,4... (finite amount of choices)
    cartesian product of domains also has to be a tuple now (no way of iterating through records properly, unless using some code generation)

Analysis module:
    write using lattice operations as parameters union...
    test back/forward, must/may
    
Examples:
    New RD
    Signs and SSR analysis
    
Manual work:
    Cartesian rework (max 2)
    NOTE: Precedence is highest for domain product! -> no Q -> (P(Q) * P(Q))?
    
Report:
    Generation of domain
    Latt operation module
