P(VAR * [Q U {QM1}] * Q) * P(ARR * [Q U {QM2}] * Q)

Reaching Definitions Analysis: 
    Last edge (pair of nodes) where each variable and array may have been modified.
    May also be a question mark (QM) if the variable may not have been modified since the start of the code


Note that elements are unique in the domain (QM1/QM2). 
Since VAR and ARR are used, then the program must contain at least one variable and one array.
Uses the Cartesian product of domains semantics to separate into a tuple, with a value for each case.
