P(VAR * [Q * Q U {QM1}]) * P(ARR * [Q * Q U {QM2}])

Reaching Definitions Analysis: 
    Last edge (pair of nodes) where each variable and array may have been modified.
    May also be a question mark (QM) if the variable may not have been modified since the start of the code


Since QM (?) only happens in start, it doesn't need the node, so reformulated to either two nodes or QM
